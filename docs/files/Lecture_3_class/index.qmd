## Random Variables

A random variable is function that maps the sample space to real value.

# Discrete Random Variables

## Discrete Random Variables

A random variable is considered to be discrete if it can only map to a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values.

## PMF

The probability mass function of discrete variable can be represented by a formula, table, or a graph. The Probability of a random variable Y can be expressed as $P(Y=y)$ for all values of $y$.

## CDF

The cumulative distribution function provides the $P(Y\leq y)$ for a random variable $Y$.

## Expected Value

The *expected value* is the value we expect when we randomly sample from population that follows a specific distribution. The expected value of Y is

$$
E(Y)=\sum_y yP(y)
$$

## Variance

The *variance* is the expected squared difference between the random variable and expected value.

$$
Var(Y)=\sum_y\{y-E(Y)\}^2P(y)
$$

$$
Var(Y) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2
$$

# Binomial Distribution

## Binomial Distribution

An experiment is said to follow a binomial distribution if

1.  Fixed $n$
2.  Each trial has 2 outcomes
3.  The probability of success is a constant $p$
4.  The trials are independent of each

# Poisson Distribution

## Poisson Distribution

The poisson distribution describes an experiment that measures that occurrence of an event at specific point and/or time period.

::: fragment
$P(X=x)=\frac{\lambda^x}{x!}e^{-\lambda}$

## Expected Value of a Poisson Distribution

# Continuous Random Variables

## Continuous Random Variables

A random variable $X$ is considered continuous if the $P(X=x)$ does not exist.

## CDF

The cumulative distribution function of $X$ provides the $P(X\leq x)$, denoted by $F(x)$, for the domain of $X$.

Properties of the CDF of $X$:

1.  $F(-\infty)\equiv \lim_{y\rightarrow -\infty}F(y)=0$
2.  $F(\infty)\equiv \lim_{y\rightarrow \infty}F(y)=1$
3.  $F(x)$ is a nondecreaseing function

## PDF

The probability density function of the random variable $X$ is given by

$$
f(x)=\frac{dF(x)}{d(x)}=F^\prime(x)
$$

wherever the derivative exists.

Properties of pdfs:

1.  $f(x)\geq 0$
2.  $\int^\infty_{-\infty}f(x)dx=1$
3.  $P(a\leq X\leq b) = P(a<X<b)=\int^b_af(x)dx$

## Expected Value

The expected value for a continuous distribution is defined as

$$
E(X)=\int x f(x)dx
$$

The expectation of a function $g(X)$ is defined as

$$
E\{g(X)\}=\int g(x)f(x)dx
$$

## Expected Value Properties

1.  $E(c)=c$, where $c$ is constant
2.  $E\{cg(X)\}=cE\{g(X)\}$
3.  $E\{g_1(X)+g_2(X)+\cdots+g_n(X)\}=E\{g_1(X)\}+E\{g_2(X)\}+\cdots+E\{g_n(X)\}$

## Variance

The variance of continuous variable is defined as

$$
Var(X) =  E[\{X-E(X)\}^2] = \int \{X-E(X)\}^2 f(x)dx 
$$

# Uniform Distribution

## Uniform Distribution

A random variable is said to follow uniform distribution if the density function is constant between two parameters.

$$
f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
 \frac{1}{b-a} & a \leq x \leq b\\
0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}
\end{array}\right.

# Normal Distribution

## Normal Distribution

A random variable is said to follow a normal distribution if the the frequency of occurrence follow a Gaussian function.

::: fragment
$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}
