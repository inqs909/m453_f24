## Learning Outcomes

-   Define Moment Generating Functions

-   Discuss Properties

# Moment Generating Functions

## Moments

The $k$th moment is defined as the expectation of the random variable, raised to the $k$th power, defined as $E(X^k)$.

## Moment Generating Functions

The moment generating functions is used to obtain the $k$th moment. The mgf is defined as

$$
m(t) = E(e^{tX})
$$

The $k$th moment can be obtained by taking the $k$th derivative of the mgf, with respect to $t$, and setting $t$ equal to 0:

$$
E(X^k)=\frac{d^km(t)}{dt}\Bigg|_{t=0}
$$

## Linearity

Let $X$ follow a distribution $f$, with the an MGF $M_X(t)$, the MGF of $Y=aX+b$ is given as

$$
M_Y(t) = e^{tb}M_X(at)
$$

## Derivation

## Linearity

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables with MGFs $M_X(t)$ and $M_Y(t)$, respectively, and are independent. The MGF of $U=X-Y$

$$
M_U(t) = M_X(t)M_Y(-t)
$$

## Derivation

## Uniqueness

Let $X$ and $Y$ have the following distributions $F_X(x)$ and $F_Y(y)$ and MGFs $M_X(t)$ and $M_Y(t)$, respectively. $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution $F_X(x)=F_Y(y)$ if and only if $M_X(t)=M_Y(t)$.

## Uniqueness

Let $X_1,\cdots, X_n$ be independent random variables, where $X_i\sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2_i)$, with $M_{X_i}(t)=\exp\{\mu_i t+\sigma^2_it^2/2\}$ for $i=1,\cdots, n$. Find the MGF of $Y=a_1X_1+\cdots+a_nX_n$, where $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ are constants.
