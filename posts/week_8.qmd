## Important Concepts

### Consistency

Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be a random sample from a distribution with parameter $\theta$. The estimator $\hat \theta$ is a consistent estimator of the $\theta$ if

1.  $E\{(\hat\theta-\theta)^2\}\rightarrow0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$
2.  $P(|\hat\theta-\theta|\ge \epsilon)\rightarrow0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$ for every $\epsilon>0$

### Sufficiency

Sufficiency evaluates whether a statistic (or estimator) contains enough information of a parameter $\theta$. In essence a statistic is considered sufficient to infer $\theta$ if it provides enough information about $\theta$.

Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be a random sample from a distribution with parameter $\theta$. A statistic $T=t(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ is said to be sufficient for making inferences of a parameter $\theta$ if condition joint distribution of $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ given $T=t$ does not depend on $\theta$.

#### Factorization Theorem

Let $f(x_1, \ldots, x_n;\theta)$ be the joint PMF of PDF of $X_1, \ldots,X_n$. Then $T=t(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ is a sufficient statistic for $\theta$ if and only if there exist 2 nonnegative functions, $g$ and $h$, such that

$$
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = g\{t(x_1,\ldots,x_n);\theta\}h(x_1,\ldots,x_n).
$$

### Minimum Sufficient Statistics

A minimum sufficient statistic is a sufficient statistic that has the smallest dimensionality, which represents the greatest possible reduction of the data without any information loss.

### Information

In Statistics, information is thought of as how much does the data tell you about a parameter $\theta$. In general, the more data is provided, the more information is provided to estimate $\theta$.

Information can be quantified using Fisher's Information $I(\theta)$. For a single observation, Fisher's Information is defined as

$$
I(\theta)=E\left[-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2}\log\{f(X;\theta)\}\right],
$$

where $f(X;\theta)$ is either the PMF or PDF of the random variable $X$. Furthermore, $I(\theta)$ can be defined as

$$
I(\theta)=Var\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f(X;\theta)\right\}.
$$

#### Additive Principle

Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be a random sample from a distribution with parameter $\theta$, then Fisher's Information for the random sample is defined as

$$
I_n(\theta)=nI(\theta)
$$
