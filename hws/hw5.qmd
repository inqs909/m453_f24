1.  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be iid with the following density function

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    (\theta + 1)x^\theta& 0\le x\le 1;\theta>-1 \\
    0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$

    Find the MLE for $\theta$.

2.  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be iid with the following density function

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\theta^\alpha}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x/\theta} & 0<x;0< \theta \\
    0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$

    where $\alpha>0$ is known. Find the MLE for $\theta$.

3.  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be iid with the following density function

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    e^{-(x-\theta)} & x>\theta \\
    0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$

    Find the method of moment estimator for $\theta$.
