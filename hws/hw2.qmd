**Homework 2 is due 9/16/2024 at 11:59 PM. Submit your homework on Canvas as one PDF document.**

The PDF version of this assignment can be found [here](hw2.pdf).

1.  $X$ is a random variable with the following pdf $f(x)=\frac{2x}{\pi^2}$ for $x\in [0,\pi]$, show that the pdf is valid.

2.  $X\sim Pois(\lambda)$, what is the moment generating function of $Y=\log(X+4)$?

3.  Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with PMF

    $$
    P(X=x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    0.25+0.5e^{-\theta} & x =0 \\
    0.25+0.5\theta e^{-\theta} & x =1 \\
    0.5\frac{\theta^x}{x!}e^{-\theta} & x = 2,3,\ldots\\
    0 & \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{array}\right.
    $$ Show that the PMF is valid.

4.  Let $Y$ be random variable with support $(0,1)$. What is the normalizing constant $c$ to make $f(x)=cx$ valid?
