**Homework 4 is due 10/14/2022 at 11:59 PM. Submit your homework on Canvas as one PDF document.**

The PDF version of this assignment can be found [here](hw4.pdf).

1.  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be iid with the following density function

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    \frac{\alpha x^{\alpha-1}}{3^\alpha}& 0\le x\le 3 \\
    0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$

    Find the method of moment estimator for $\alpha$.

2.  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be iid with the following density function

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
    \frac{1}{\theta}2xe^{-x^2/\theta} & 0<x;0< \theta \\
    0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$

    Find the MLE for $\theta$.

3.  Is the MLE estimator from Problem 2 unbiased?
